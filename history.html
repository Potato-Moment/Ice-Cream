        <p>Ice cream can be traced as far back as second century B.C.</p>
        <br>
        <p1>Marco Polo discorved a recipie that is similar to sherbet. Historians believe that his recipie evolved to become ice cream in the 1500's. England is beleived to have discovered ice cream around this time as well. In 1660, ice cream became available for the public to buy. When the first cafe in Paris opened, it included ice cream.</p1>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p2>The fist time ice cream was advertised in The United States was on May 12th 1777 in the New York Gazette.</p2>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p3>In 1851, making ice cream in The United States became a buisness not limited to the elite. This is because of the milkman Jacob Fussel. Ice cream manufacturing evolved over time with iventions such as steam power, electric refridgerators, packing machines and automobiles. Nowadays, The United States produces more than 6.4 billion pounds of ice cream per year.</p3>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p4>In 1874, stores known as 'soda fountains' in The United States began selling the ice cream soda. But there was religous backlash on having ice cream sodas on Sunday. This caused the shops to remove the soda and call it an 'Ice Cream Sunday'. This happened in the 1890s and the name has since been changed to 'sundae', to remove any relation to the holy day.</p4>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p5>During World War 2, ice cream became a symbol of morale for The United States military. The first 'floating ice creasm parlor' was built in 1945. This was for sailors who wanted ice cream. After the war ended in 1946, it is estimated that the average person ate more than 42 pounds of ice cream. This was in The United States.</p5>
